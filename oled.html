<h2>OLED TVs</h2>
<img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/tv-led-mock-screen-smart-260nw-2040768557.jpg" alt="OLED TV">
<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Superior picture quality: OLED TVs offer better contrast ratios, deeper blacks, and more vibrant colors than LED TVs, resulting in a more lifelike and immersive viewing experience.</li>
<li>Excellent viewing angles: Unlike LED TVs, OLED TVs maintain color accuracy and contrast even when viewed from wide angles. This makes them ideal for large rooms or group viewing.</li>
<li>Faster refresh rate: OLED TVs have faster refresh rates than LED TVs, which means they can display fast-moving content, like sports and action movies, more smoothly and with less motion blur.</li>
<li>Thinner and lighter design: OLED panels are thinner and lighter than LED panels, allowing for sleeker and more stylish TV designs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shorter lifespan compared to LED TVs: OLED TVs have a shorter lifespan than LED TVs due to the organic materials used in their construction. Over time, these materials degrade, causing a decrease in brightness and potential color shift.</li>
<li>More expensive than LED TVs: OLED TVs are generally more expensive than LED TVs, making them less accessible for budget-conscious consumers.</li>
<li>Risk of image retention and burn-in: OLED TVs are more susceptible to image retention and burn-in compared to LED TVs. Static images or content with fixed elements can cause permanent damage if displayed for extended periods.</li>
<li>Lower peak brightness: OLED TVs typically have lower peak brightness levels than LED TVs, which can make them less suitable for very bright rooms with lots of natural light.</li>
</ul>
